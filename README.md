# RESTfulSerivce
A RESTful service submission for Paytm software developer challenge.

To deploy this service run 'grandlew bootrun' from the project root, or run 'grandlew build' if you would like to run from a .jar. Start at localhost:8080 in your browser. Links will be provided to guide you through the service. I opted to use the Spring Framework to build this service. Spring is a popluar choice for building RESTful web services and provides decent documentation of how to use their framework. The service uses basic authenication with in memory managment for security.
