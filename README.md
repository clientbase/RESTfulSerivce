# RESTful Web Serivce
A RESTful web service submission for Paytm software developer challenge.

To deploy this service run 'gradlew bootrun' from the project root, or run 'gradlew build' if you would like to run from a .jar. Start at localhost:8080 in your browser. Links will be provided to guide you through the service. I opted to use the Spring Framework to build this service. Spring is a popluar choice for building RESTful web services and provides decent documentation of how to use their framework. The service uses basic authenication with in memory managment for security.
